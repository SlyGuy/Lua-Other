Old Ironforge:Solution A[] B[X] C[]
Map: 0 -4821 -975 464
- Notes: This place isn't very big, and is most likely suited for a boss lair or some sort of mall. Keep in mind, if players fall down, they need a way to get up.
Would be kind of annoying to be stuck in the lava.

Elwynn Falls:Solution A[X] B[] C[]
Map: 0 -8322 -340 145
- Notes: This seems to be a closed area of Elwynn Forest, and may be used for general stuffs such as mobs and quests, as in, general leveling.

Northern Plaguelands:Solution A[] B[] C[X]
Map: 0 3852 -3565 45
- Notes: This is the area surrounded by the Plagueland areas. It's completely empty, and has one damn annoying fog, so it could be used for some scary outdoor boss raid, I guess.

Graymane Area:Solution A[X] B[] C[]
Map: 0 -979 1579 52
- Notes: This is the awesome area past the big annoying gate in Silverpine Forest. If you can find a neat way to get here, it would probably be good for some sort of city.

Isolated Dun Morogh:Solution A[] B[X] C[]
Map: 0 -4897 836 390
- Notes: As Cursed mentioned, this area would be good for a linear instance. It's very open, and as far as I know, normally inaccessible from the outside. Not instanced, though.

Arathi Highlands Farm: Solution A[X] B[] C[]
Map: 0 -1817 -4205 3
- Notes: Not much to say. I'd probably use it for some sort of secret hideout, as it's a nice little isolated place.

Isolated Wetlands Town: Solution A[X] B[] C[]
Map: 0 -4037 -1408 157
- Notes: This place is awesome! You can have your own little closed town here. Only thing is, you need to close that tunnel leading to nothing.

Above Undercity Glitch: Solution A[X] B[] C[]
Map: 0 1545 150 61

Blackchar Cave: Solution A[] B[X] C[]
Map: 0 -7347 -642 294
- Notes: Now, this is a strange place indeed! It's just a little cave that isn't really good for anything other than a mall, maybe? I find it kind of funny, though.
For some reason, on retail, Blizzard does a very good job to keep you out of here...

Ortell's Hideout: Solution A[] B[X] C[]
Map: 0 -5314 -2512 484
- Notes: Just some strange cave in the mountains. Could be some sort of special event place, maybe?

Newman's Landing: Solution A[X] B[] C[]

Dun'Morogh's Troll cave
-Coords: 0 -4615 -804 642.5
-Note: A cave with one troll riding a road nexto it with a wolf and another troll
just camping near the cave. The place is seen by flying from Wetlands to Ironforge, so its mostly an eyecandy.
Left to the cave theres a crashed gnome plane, what a surprise... It has even bones and equipment of its pilot down to it.

Forgotten gnome camp

Karazhan Crypts:Solution A[X] B[] C[]
Map: 0 -11069 -1795 54
- Note: This location is not instanced. This place is probably good for an outdoor raid, or something similar.
Could also be used for a normal zone, although, it's not very big, and there's some annoying invisible wall blocking the way down here, so you might want to consider that.


Kalimdor

Uninstanced Ahn'Qiraj: Solution A[] B[X] C[]
Map: 1 -9479 1783 49
- Notes: This is sort of a big ruin valley. What makes it awesome is that it's extremely huge, has a dark fog, and is outside!

-Note:
A floating island with a skeleton lying on the ground with a axe on its head and around apples on him dropped down from nearly
apple tree. Its a reference to Newton which was hitten by an apple and after that he "invented" gravitation. This might explain
the floating islands on Outland.

corner of the sandbox. Inside the hut, however, is the first known Night Elf Baby seen the in the game. As well as the first

areas, one Horde, one Alliance and one Neutral. 

Old Scarlet monestary:Solution A[] B[X] C[]
Map: 44 126 -1 19
-Note:
Blizzard designed the SM to be a connected instance, whit connected i mean that all the 4 parts of SM were
ment to be together when release came out but everything didn\'t come out like that. Blizzard wanted the
parts of the SM be seperated to easier and harder parts. Althought the Old SM still exists ingame and it
has pretty great looking graphics and amazing story to tell.


Stormwind Vault:Solution A[] B[X] C[]
-Note: 35 -1 52 -27
-Note:The Stormwind Vault is a prison within the human capital of Stormwind, it is a lot bigger scale than the

remains unused in WoW. The place is titled strangely "The Stockade: Stormwind Vault".

You'll love it.

Instanced Tanaris: Solution A[] B[X] C[]
Map: 209 1075 860 9
